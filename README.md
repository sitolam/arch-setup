# arch-setup

arch-setup is a console menu based (TUI) install script for Arch Linux.

The goal of this project is to provide a "Debian-like" install experience for new users interested
in Arch Linux. Nearly every aspect of the install process is configurable by the installer. However,
when it comes to more complicated aspects such as partitioning, the installer uses sane defaults to
keep the installation process as user friendly as possible.

## Disclamer: need to update documentation
## Usage

### Prerequisites

* Bootable installation media
  * First, [download](https://www.archlinux.org/download/) the latest Arch ISO. Then, follow the instructions to [create a bootable device](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_flash_installation_media)
* Working internet connection
  * If you require a wireless connection, use the `iwctl` command to [connect to a network](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Iwd#iwctl)

### Downloading and Running the Script

1. Once you have booted into the live media, sync `pacman -Syy` and install git and dialog: `pacman -Syy git dialog`
   * If you encounter `error: not enough free disk space`, then increase cowspace:

     `mount -o remount,size=1G /run/archiso/cowspace`
    * If you encouter signature issues do this:
      ```bash
      umount /etc/pacman.d/gnupg
      sudo rm -rf /etc/pacman.d/gnupg
      pacman-key --init
      pacman-key --populate
      ```

3. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/sitolam/arch-setup && cd arch-setup/`
4. Run the script: `./setup`
